# Why????  WHY!?!??

This repo is full of some turn-key custom module examples, written in simple languages.  
They don't require a python guru to understand the function, and they're part of a greater
effort to demystify the interaction between Ansible and the module itself.

They are meant to assist in learning the process to build your own custom module and make it work inside a custom Ansible collection.

These modules show examples of variable and status inputs so that you can process and "do stuff" with the framework.
