## Lab Setup

### Deployment
- Option 1: [AWS Provisioner](https://github.com/redhat-partner-tech/partner-tech-days-march2021/blob/main/integrated-mgmt-workshop/provision-aws.md) (Ansible)  
- Option 2: [RHPDS](https://github.com/redhat-partner-tech/partner-tech-days-march2021/blob/main/integrated-mgmt-workshop/provision-rhpds.md) (Coming soon)

### Configure
*This step is only applicable if you did Option 1 for deployment.*<br><br>
After the workshop is deployed, you will need to configure the environment. This step will configure the deployed environment, including Activation Keys, Lifecycle Environments, Registering Servers to Satellite Server, etc.
